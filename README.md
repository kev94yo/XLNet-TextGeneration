# XLNet-TextGeneration
This notebook builds a bidirectional text generator with XLNet. It is basically a walk-through of this [medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-bidirectional-text-generator-with-xlnet-49d9d37b48a9) by Rostyslav Neskorozhenyi, with added notes and separation for clarity of what the code means. Additional background information on the XLNet architecture and idea is included in the beginning.
## Requirements
The `transformers` library is the only required library for this notebook
## Text Generation
Follow the notebook, and change the initial sentence variable with a text of your choice. Change parameters to control the length of beams and text generated
